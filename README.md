## Installation
If you wish to run the code locally run the following:

```

## Application

### Technology Stack
- Bootstrapped with Create-React-App
- State handled with Redux & Redux-Toolkit
- Styled with JSS

### Spotify Authentication
Spotify uses OAuth2 for authentication and authorization. On initial setup [App Authorisation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/) will be initiated. This requests an authorisation token, on success it returns to /app, and includes the following scopes:
- playlist-read-private, playlist-read-collaborative, playlist-modify-public, user-read-recently-played, playlist-modify-private, ugc-image-upload, user-follow-modify, user-follow-read, user-library-read, user-library-modify, user-read-private, user-read-email, user-top-read, user-read-playback-state.


## Development

### Application Structure
Components are organised under a loose interptretation of the [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) system.

### Deployment
The application is automatically [deployed onto Vercel](https://react-spotify-2.ianhuet.vercel.app) courtesy of a webhook on the Master branch, and Vercels splendid, free tooling.

### Changelog
All updates are tracked in the [Changelog](https://github.com/ianhuet/react-spotify/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) under [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
