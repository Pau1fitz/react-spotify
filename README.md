# React-Spotify 🎼🎺🎸🎻🎤

This is `React-Spotify`, a React front end client that communicates with the Spotify API.

See it in action [here](http://pau1fitz.github.io/react-spotify).

If you don't have a spotify account, don't worry, you can use the following credentials:

> email: spotifyreact@gmail.com

> password: Example


![alt text](https://github.com/Pau1fitz/react-spotify/blob/master/songs.png "Song")
![alt text](https://github.com/Pau1fitz/react-spotify/blob/master/browser.png "Browse")

If you wish to run the code locally run the following.

```
yarn
yarn start
visit http://localhost:3000
```

Please note that the Spotify API only provides 30 second audio snippets. It may be possible to get the full track by using the [Web Playback SDK](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/).
